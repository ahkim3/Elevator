Instructions:

To compile, run:
g++ *.cpp -o Prog3 -Wall -Werror

Then, run:

On a single line (seperated by spaces), input: floors, start, goal, up, and down, where 1 <= s, g <= f <= 100 and 0 <= u, d <= 100.

The program will out the sequence with the minimum number of pushes you must make in order to get from s to g, or output "use the stairs" if it is impossible given the configuration of the elevator.
